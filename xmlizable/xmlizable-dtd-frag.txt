<!--
    There are two kinds of elements - object and primitive - but each
    element can be represented in its long or condensed form.

    Also, this does not define an entire DTD, because it does not define
    a root document element (DOCTYPE). The Xmlizable elements are intended
    to be contained within your documents.

    This DTD fragment is here so that you can cut and paste this fragment
    into your document's DTD to ensure that your document can be validated.

    Of course if you're not trying to validate your documents, then you can
    ignore this DTD fragment altogether.
