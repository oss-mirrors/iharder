\Abstract{%
 This sample paper shows one way to use the sf298 package along with
 the article documentclass to generate a paper with the standard form 298
 as the second physical page in the document.

 In addition, the common text of the title, authors and abstract are
 shared and the ``{\tt \string\thanks}'' macro is treated specially so
 that it is active for the titlepage and inactive for the report
 documentation page.}
